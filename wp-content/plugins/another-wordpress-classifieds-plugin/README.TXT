== Installation ==

Pre-installation note: If you have previously tried other WordPress classified plugins and plan to use the same page, please make sure your database has been cleared of any posts with the same name or slug as your classifieds page.
For example, if your page will be named "Auto Listings", you might have a wp_posts database entry post_title value of "Auto Listings" and post_name value of "auto-listings" still left over from previous plugins.
You need to check your database to make sure old data does not exist. Delete all entries from your wp_posts table where the post_title and post_name are the same as your classifieds page.

1. Upload the folder another-wordpress-classifieds-plugin with its contents to wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate the plugin
3. Click on the "Click here to setup your site options" link and fill out all your various options to configure how you want your classifieds to run.
4. Create some categories and sub categories for your ads.
5. Set up your payment fees if you are going to be running in pay mode.

Your classified directory should now be ready and working.

= What types of classified listing directories can I create? =

Our classifieds website builder software combined with our add-on modules is the most powerful classifieds plugin on the market. The options for classified advertising are limitless. Here are a few types of classified directories you can create:

* Job board listings and help wanted
* Auto, truck, and car listings
* Apartment classifieds
* Property and real estate listings
* Dating and personal listings
* Fashion listings to buy and sell clothing
* Announcements for events like yard sales, reunions, auctions, and school events

= Can AWP Classifieds support paid and free listings? =
Yes it can. You can do this by creating fee plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time. For more details, read [this article](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-freepaid).

= Will AWP Classifieds work with my theme? =
Our WordPress classifieds plugin will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.

In general, we like WooThemes as a solid company with great products and support. You can check them out [here](http://woothemes.com) Or [StudioPress](http://studiopress.com​​)

= Can this plugin be translated into my language? =
Yes it can. Our Classifieds directory plugin comes with many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. For details on how to do it, our [translation guide](https://awpcp.com/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion#qs-translate) will help get you started.

= Is AWP Classifieds compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)? =
Yes it is. However, you cannot "network-activate" the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the subsites on which you need a directory. This can be done under Plugins->Add New as the Administrator user. Do not "network activate" AWPCP as the "super admin".
